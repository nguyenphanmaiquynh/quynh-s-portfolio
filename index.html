        <div class='description'>My name is Nguyen Phan Mai Quynh. I was born on the 20th May 1999. I am currently
          studying at RMIT South Saigon Campus and my major is Bachelor of Digital Media. Although English language was
          my
          main subject of study during childhood and highschool years, I've decided to pursue studying Design and
          Illustration. Therefore, comparing to my peers in the creative industry, I am considered to be a potato.
          However, I am still improving and trying my best to enhance my skills. Since I have lots of issues regarding
          low
          self-esteem and peer-pressure, I have tried a great number of solutions to face my problems and improve my
          technical as well as my soft skills. For examples, I usually take online and extra art courses besides hours
          studying at RMIT University. Hence, comparing to my past self, I have improved a lot. Although I have not
          found
          out my personal artstyle yet, I could use my drawing skills to make ends meet for myself. The road ahead is
          still rough for me, but I will try my best.</div>
